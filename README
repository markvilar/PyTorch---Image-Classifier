# My repository for the final project in the Udacity Nanodegree: "AI programming with Python"

The project was to implement a light weight command line application to create various different CNN architectures.
The application is implement with PyTorch, NumPy and standard Python libraries and utilizes the deep learning technique 
called "transfer-learning", where pre-trained feature extractors are used as the back bone for application pipe line. The
appliation was tested with various different models on the "Flower" dataset 
(https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz).
